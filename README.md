# Machine Learning School

This repository contains the source code of the [Machine Learning School](https://www.ml.school) program.

If you find any problems with the code or have any ideas on improving it, please open an issue and share your recommendations.

## Running the code

Before running the project, follow the [Setup instructions](https://program.ml.school/setup.html). After that, you can test the code by running the following command:

```
