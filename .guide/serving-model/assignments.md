14. **Model Performance Monitoring**: Add a step that simulates production inference scenarios and monitors model latency, memory usage, and prediction consistency across different input sizes.


15. **Automated Model Rollback**: Implement logic that automatically rolls back to the previous model version if the newly registered model's performance degrades below the previous version's metrics during validation.

16. **Multi-Environment Deployment**: Modify the pipeline to support deployment to multiple environments (staging, production) with environment-specific configurations and validation gates.
