# Introduction

"Building AI & Machine Learning Systems That Don't Suck" is designed to teach you how to train, evaluate, deploy, and monitor AI and Machine Learning systems in production.

In this repository, you'll find an end-to-end system that you can use as a starting point for your projects. This template uses the [Penguins dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data) to train a model capable of classifying penguin species.

This guide provides instructions on how to implement each component of the solution and how to deploy and run the system locally and on different cloud platforms.

Here is a high-level architecture diagram showing the main components of the solution:

If you find any issues with the code or have any ideas for improving it, please reach out with your recommendations.
