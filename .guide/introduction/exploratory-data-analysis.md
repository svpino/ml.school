# Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step for understanding the structure and characteristics of a dataset before we use it to build a model.

During this process, we want to identify any anomalies with the data and try to discover patterns and insights that will guide the project. Exploratory Data Analysis also helps validate assumptions, informing feature engineering, and ensuring a solid foundation for modeling.

The [Exploratory Data Analysis notebook](notebooks/eda.ipynb) loads the initial dataset and systematically explores its structure and content. It looks at the distribution of the target variable, the distribution of the features, and the relationships between them.

[Open the notebook](notebooks/eda.ipynb), select a kernel, and run it line by line to understand the entire process.

Some of the decisions that you'll see later on when preprocessing the data are based on the insights gained during the Exploratory Data Analysis process.
