# Assignments

Complete the following assignments to reinforce the concepts we covered in this session. You don't have to work on every assignment. Pick the ones that you think will help you the most.

1. Update the Monitoring pipeline with a new step that uses an LLM to generate a summary of the metrics generated by the pipeline. The goal is to use this summary to understand the performance of the pipeline at a glance.

1. Extend the Monitoring pipeline to include a new step that checks for target drift between the reference dataset and the current production data. Target drift occurs when the distribution of the ground truth labels changes over time.

1. Modify the `start` step of the Monitoring pipeline to allow filtering production data by time (e.g. last 7 days vs last 30 days). This should be done by adding a new parameter to the pipeline and using it to filter the production data.

1. Modify the Traffic pipeline with a new parameter to simulate drift in any of the features of production data. Generate new data with drift and ensure the Monitoring pipeline flags it.

1. Modify the `end` step of the Monitoring pipeline to serialize every JSON report generated by Evidently and save them to a versioned S3 location.

1. Modify the [Training pipeline](src/pipelines/training.py) with a new data validation step that checks for data quality issues like missing values, outliers, or data drift before training. The step should generate a data quality report and optionally fail the pipeline if quality metrics fall below thresholds.
