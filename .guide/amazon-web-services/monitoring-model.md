# Monitoring Model In Sagemaker

The Monitoring pipeline supports monitoring models hosted in Sagemaker. For more information on how the pipeline works, check the [Monitoring pipeline](.guide/monitoring-pipeline/introduction.md) section.

Before running the Monitoring pipeline, we'll generate some traffic for the hosted model. You can do that by running the following command:

```shell
uv run pipelines/traffic.py \
    --config config config/sagemaker.json run \
    --backend backend.Sagemaker
```

You can also run the pipeline using `just` along with the `sagemaker-traffic` recipe:

```shell
just sagemaker-traffic
```

It will take a few minutes for Sagemaker to store the captured data in the location specified when you deployed the model. After that, you can run the following command to generate fake ground truth labels for the captured data:

```shell
uv run pipelines/labels.py \
    --config config config/sagemaker.json run \
    --backend backend.Sagemaker
```

Set up Metaflow's built-in viewer for the Monitoring pipeline by running the command below and navigating in your browser toÂ [localhost:8324](http://localhost:8324/):

```shell
uv run pipelines/monitoring.py card server \
```

You can also use the `just` command with the `sagemaker-monitor-viewer` recipe:

```shell
just sagemaker-monitor-viewer
```

Finally, run the Monitoring pipeline using the command below:

```shell
uv run pipelines/monitoring.py \
    --config config config/sagemaker.json run \
    --backend backend.Sagemaker
```

You can also use the `just` command with the `sagemaker-monitor` recipe:

```shell
just sagemaker-monitor
```

You will see every report generated by the pipeline in the built-in viewer opened in your browser.
