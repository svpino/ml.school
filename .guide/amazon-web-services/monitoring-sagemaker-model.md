# Monitoring Sagemaker Model

The [Monitoring pipeline](src/pipelines/monitoring.py) supports monitoring models hosted in Sagemaker. For more information on how the pipeline works, check the [Monitoring pipeline](.guide/monitoring-pipeline/introduction.md) section.

Before running the pipeline, we'll generate some traffic for the hosted model. You can do that by running the following recipe:

```shell
just sagemaker-traffic
```

It will take a few minutes for Sagemaker to store the captured data in the location specified when you deployed the model. After that, you can run the following command to generate fake ground truth labels for the captured data:

```shell
just sagemaker-labels
```

Set up Metaflow's built-in viewer by running the command below and navigating in your browser toÂ [localhost:8324](http://localhost:8324/):

```shell
uv run src/pipelines/monitoring.py card server
```

Finally, run the pipeline using the command below:

```shell
just sagemaker-monitor
```

You will see every report generated by the pipeline in the built-in viewer opened in your browser.
