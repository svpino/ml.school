# Deploying Model To Sagemaker

You can use the Deployment pipeline to deploy the latest model from the Model Registry to different deployment targets. The pipeline will connect to the specified target platform, create a new endpoint to host the model, and run a few samples to test that everything works as expected.

To deploy the model to Sagemaker, you'll need access to `ml.m4.xlarge` instances. By default, the quota for most new accounts is zero, so you might need to request a quota increase. You can do this in your AWS account under "Service Quotas" > "AWS Services" > "Amazon Sagemaker". Find `ml.m4.xlarge for endpoint usage` and request a quota increase of 8 instances.

Start by creating an environment variable with the endpoint name you want to create. The following command will append the variable to the `.env` file and export it in your current shell:

```shell
export $((echo "ENDPOINT_NAME=penguins" >> .env; cat .env) | xargs)
```

Before deploying the model to Sagemaker, you must build a Docker image and push it to the [Elastic Container Registry](https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/) (ECR). You can do this by running the following command:

```shell
uv run -- mlflow sagemaker build-and-push-container
```

**macOS users**: Before running the above command, open the Docker Desktop application and under Advanced Settings, select the option "Allow the default Docker socket to be used" and restart Docker.

Once the image finishes uploading, run the [Training pipeline](.guide/training-pipeline/introduction.md). After you have successfuly ran this pipeline, you can proceed to run the deployment pipeline from the repository's root directory:

```shell
uv run -- python pipelines/deployment.py \
  --config config config/sagemaker.json \
  --environment conda run \
  --backend backend.Sagemaker
```

You can also run the pipeline using `just` along with the `sagemaker` recipe:

```shell
just sagemaker-deploy
```

To deploy the model to Sagemaker, we need to use the `--backend` parameter to specify the `backend.Sagemaker` class. We'll use the `config/sagemaker.json` configuration file to set up the instance. Here are the available configuration parameters:

* `target`: The target endpoint name. You can set this parameter to the `ENDPOINT_NAME` environment variable.
* `data-capture-destination`: The S3 bucket where Sagemaker will store the input data and predictions. This parameter is optional. If you specify it, Sagemaker will automatically capture the input data received by the endpoint and the predictions generated by the model. This information will be stored in the specified location. You can use this later to monitor the model's performance.
* `region`: The AWS region where the endpoint will be created. You can set this parameter to the `AWS_REGION` environment variable.

After the pipeline finishes running, you can test the endpoint from your terminal using the following command:

```shell
just sagemaker-invoke
```

As soon as you are done with the Sagemaker endpoint, delete it to avoid unnecessary costs. Check the [Cleaning up AWS resources](.guide/aws/cleaning-up.md) section for more information.
