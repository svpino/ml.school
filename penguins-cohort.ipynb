    "This session aims to build a simple [SageMaker Pipeline](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pipelines-sdk.html) with one step to preprocess the [Penguins dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/palmer-archipelago-antarctica-penguin-data).

Check the [SageMaker Pipelines Overview](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/pipelines-sdk.html) for an introduction to the fundamental components of a SageMaker Pipeline.\n",

You can check [Batch Transform](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/batch-transform.html) for more information about Batch Transform Jobs.\n",
